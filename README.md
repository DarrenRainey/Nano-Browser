Nano-Browser
============

Nano browser is a secure minimalistic web browser I created for windows xp if you have the latest version of the .NET framework install you should be able to run this

Nano browser is designed to be used on old computers with low ram and storage and is optimised for most addons Flash Java etc. However I would recommend disablising flash and Java if not need as this uses unnecessary resources (ram) and can make you vulnerable.

Set-up
============
You can download an installer file from /build/latest/installer.exe

or

you can compile the source code if you have visual studio 2013 installed just clone this repository and open it in visual Studio
